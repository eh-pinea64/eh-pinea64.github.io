title: What is this?
---

On this blog, articles are linked that I have read with interest and want to keep. This site is for me a way to archive these articles. I will use this blog as a reference. Because publicly accessible, for other people as a source of good quality articles.
I can use [Pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in), [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) or [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) for archiving of links.
But. I can also dedicate a blog to it, and that is what I have decided. 

This collection of links (pinboard, lens, give it a name) is heavily inspired by [Marco Hamersma](https://marcohamersma.com/pinboard/) and [Laura Kalbag](https://laurakalbag.com/lens/).

If an article is listed on this blog, reading that article is in my opinion a meaningful use of time, even if it is a longread :-)

I think it is useful for you as a reader of the articles to give a little disclaimer. 
From the point of view of the writers and my chosen quote(s) you cannot necessarily conclude the point of view of me.
