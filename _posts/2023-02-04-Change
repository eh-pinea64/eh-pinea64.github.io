"...change is the only constant we have in life."

"Change is the delta between today and tomorrow. Itâ€™s the discrepancy between who we are and who we want to be. The diff between the status quo and the future we desire."

"Without change everything would remain the same. Ambitions would remain dreams and dreams would remain fantasies."
