"The password manager’s [LastPass] most recent data breach is so concerning, users need to take immediate steps to protect themselves."

"with vaults recovered, the people who hacked LastPass have unlimited time for offline attacks by guessing passwords and attempting to recover specific users’ master keys."

"They [LastPass] failed to do the one thing they are supposed to provide--cloud-based secure credential storage."
