"Is Mohammed Salah playing well because Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson are also on the field? It’s hard to say. But there are things you can quantify. You can take the geography of the field and figure out when a possession reaches a certain area on the field that it’s x percent likely to lead to a goal. Then you can figure out if a player wins a tackle in that certain area, then he’s probably increased his team’s chances of scoring a goal and probably taken away a certain value from the other team."
